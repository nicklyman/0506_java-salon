#### _A web application for tracking which clients see which stylists at a hair salon, May 6, 2016_

#### By _**Nick Lyman**_

## Description

_This web app uses Java and a SQL database for storing and keeping track of the client list for each stylist. It is currently set up for allowing a client to see only one stylist for a one to many relationship. A user is able to add, update, or remove the name of one or more stylist and/or the name of one or more clients, as well as assign which stylist the client will visit._
